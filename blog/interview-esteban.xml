	<p>
	This is the second post of my series of interviews, in which I
	<a href="http://nicolas-petton.fr/blog/working-at-rmod.html">interview my colleagues</a> of the <a href="http://rmod.lille.inria.fr/web/">RMoD</a> team. After the <a href="http://nicolas-petton.fr/blog/interview-damien.html">interview of
	Damien Cassou</a>, I interview <a href="http://smallworks.com.ar/web/blog">Esteban Lorenzano</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
	Esteban joined RMoD almost at the same time as I did, two years
	ago. We since became very good friends, and often meet after work or
	during weekends, being for a beer somewhere in Lille or an evening
	sharing a dinner or simply talking, with other colleagues or friends.
	</p>

	<p>
	We also have a lot in common when it comes to work, and often work
	together on <a href="http://smalltalkhub.com/#!/~francois/MongoTalk">various</a> <a href="http://smalltalkhub.com/#!/~estebanlm/Voyage/">projects</a>. We are both passionate about
	Smalltalk, web development and databases.
	</p>

	<p>
	<b><i>Hi Esteban, thanks for taking this interview. Can you tell me a
	bit about yourself and how you joined RMoD?</i></b>
	</p>

	<p>
	Well, my name is Esteban Lorenzano and I&rsquo;m argentinian (one of the
	many argentinians in the Pharo community). I&rsquo;m 42 years old and I&rsquo;ve
	spent the biggest part of my life programming, since I saw a
	Commodore computer in a supermarket, when I was fourteen. 
	</p>

	<p>
	Watching people doing stuff with that computer was like seeing a
	wizard transforming the world, and that image cached me from that
	moment and forever. It was not always easy thought, and I spent too
	many years programming in mainstream languages (I like some, I hate
	others) until I re-discovered my programmer vocation one day that I
	downloaded a Seaside, &ldquo;just to have inspiration and fun, while
	working on really boring stuff&rdquo;... and the rest is history: I left my
	position of &ldquo;senior architect&rdquo; and founded my own company with two
	friends (smallworks.eu) to work on Pharo (very new at the moment)
	and Seaside, and I&rsquo;ve been contributing with Pharo since then, in
	different small projects. 
	</p>

	<p>
	Then for different non-work related reasons, after two years me and
	my company became just one (my friends needed to switch to other
	projects) and I was also ending a relationship. Just at the same
	time Stef and Marcus proposed me to join the RMoD team as Pharo
	engineer. It was perfect timing for me, and here I am, in the best
	job I have ever had.  
	</p>

	<p>
	When I&rsquo;m not hacking something (at work or at my place), I have also
	a lot of different interests: I love to read, to write stories, to
	travel, to learn new stuff: I studied philosophy (yet not ended) and
	I try to be aware of the problems at my country and the world (and
	even try to help, when I see that I can do something). Last but not
	least, I love to spend time just hanging out with my friends.
	</p>


	<p>
	<b><i>Damien had a question for the next interview: What would you change
	in the team to make it even more awesome?</i></b>
	</p>

	<p>
	No clue :)
	</p>

	<p>
	I think as a team we have a lot of stimulus and excitment, but
	sometimes due the very nature of the team (which in fact is a research
	team), we have problems to get focus in the engineering part of Pharo:
	we are so exited for including new stuff or exploring some areas that
	we lose the need of committing to a task and not stop until is
	finished. If I have to improve something, it would be that part.
	</p>


	<p>
	<b><i>Thank you Esteban!</i></b>
