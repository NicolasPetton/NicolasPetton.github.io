    <p>
    This is the fourth post of my series of interviews of my colleagues
    at <a href="http://foretagsplatsen.se">FTGP</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Seçkin is the newling sofware engineer at Företagsplatsen, coming to us straight
    from Turkey (well, that's not entirely true, as he got his Master degree in
    Stockholm).
    </p>

    <p>
    <b><i>Hi Seçkin, thanks for taking this interview.
    First things first, could you tell me a bit about yourself?</i></b>
    </p>

    <p>
    I'm Seçkin Savaşçı (rough translation : distinguished warrior). I'm a 24
    year old computer engineer from Turkey. I got my BSc from Bogazici
    University, Istanbul.  I initially came to Sweden for my master studies in
    distributed computing at KTH, decided to stay because of the weather(!). I
    have recently started working at Företagsplatsen, so I am the new guy
    around here.
    </p>

    <p>
    Some random facts about me: I play various instruments and played football,
    basketball, and table tennis competitively. I like to cook and I love to eat. I
    know some Krav Maga.  My hometown, Adana, is famous for the original Kebab (Look
    at this beauty). I have lived in Adana, Istanbul, Utrecht, and Lisbon before.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b><i>Question #2: What do you do on your free time? (both in front of and away from your computer)</i></b>
    </p>

    <p>
    I aim to have no free time. However, I get lazy from time to time. In that case, reading a book or simply doing nothing is my usual
    routine. If you ask me what I do in my pseudo-free time and not get paid in the process, then there are several activities : I try to
    attend as many football meetups as I can in Stockholm Sporty People Meetup. I play some computer games, I have started experimenting
    to stream it. I'm planning to commit serious time and effort for mastering my instruments when I finally bring them from my family
    home. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b><i>Question #3: How was your first week in the development team?</i></b>
    </p>

    <p>
    It was literally awesome; scary but inspiring. This is actually my first job
    so everything about workspace and working in general is new to me. As
    expected, I spent some time setting up my development machine. 
    </p>

    <p>
    I didn't have proper introduction to most of the aspects of the project but I
    quickly contributed to the team; I solved some problems, even one or two was
    kind of critical. I also did some mistakes, once pushed to a wrong branch and
    another time merged my own commits. 
    </p>

    <p>
    I tend to ask plenty of questions, so I did. My first week was a lot of
    fun. (Warning : Today was 13th day of my career.)<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>

    <p>
    <b><i>Question #4: During her interview, Louise had a question for the next interview</i></b>
    </p>

    <p>
    <i>What do you think that your personality can provide to Företagsplatsen,
    as a co-worker, that no one else at this company can?</i>
    </p>

    <p>
    It is a hard question because it prerequisites understanding others'
    personalities. I don't have a definite answer but I can say that I am more
    inclined to rebuilding things from scratch. I will probably be leading when we
    go for v4.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b><i>Question #5: If you were giving an interview, what question would you ask another member of the team?</i></b>
    </p>

    <p>
    "What makes you mad? Really really mad, not something ephemeral."  
    </p>

    <p>
    <b><i>Thank you Seckin!</i></b>
    </p>
