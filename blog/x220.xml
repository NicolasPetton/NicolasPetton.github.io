    <p>
    I've been looking for a second hand laptop to use at home and for travelling for
    a while, so that I wouldn't have to carry my primary laptop from and to work
    every day.
    </p>

    <p>
    I've been using a ThinkPad t440s for the last 2 years, and I'm really happy with
    it.  The keyboard - while being a chiclet keyboard - feels really good, the
    laptop is quite lightweight and slim for a 14 inches, and the IPS matte screen
    is amazing: it has very good viewing angles, a high resolution, and vibrant
    colors. However, I'm not happy at all with the trackpad, which lacks physical
    buttons, making the trackpoint pretty useless on this machine, a shame for a
    ThinkPad.
    </p>

    <p>
    After doing a bit of research, I decided to go for a refurbished ThinkPad
    x220. I found one in a local store in a very good shape, the laptop looks almost
    brand new, and it was pretty cheap (around 300â‚¬).
    </p>

    <p>
    It didn't have an IPS panel when I bought it, which is now a must for me, so I
    bought one on Ebay.  Same for the hard drive, I replaced it with an SSD.

    <p>
    I think the x220 is an amazing little machine!  
    </p>

    <p>
    It sure looks a bit oldish, but I don't mind that, I actually like its "good old
    ThinkPad" style, and the laptop feels very durable.
    </p>

    <p>
    I thought at first that a 12.5 inches display might be too small, but it's
    actually ok, and the IPS matte panel is of very good quality.
    </p>

    <p>
    The laptop is lightweight, small and easy to carry, even if it's a bit thick,
    which makes it the perfect travel companion.
    </p>

    <p>
    With a second generation Intel i7, 8Gb of RAM and a SSD, the machine is very
    responsive, actually almost as good as my t440s.
    </p>

    <p>
    The battery life is quite decent for a 5 years old computer: I got 4.5 hours
    with Fedora, doing Emacs hacking, with a browser open and a few terminals, using
    Wifi and with the screen brightness at 80%.  My x220 has the 6 cells battery, it
    still has about 80 percent of its original capacity, but I'm considering buying
    a brand new 9 cells battery to replace it.
    </p>

    <p>
    What is really amazing with this ThinkPad is the keyboard.  I thought that the
    keyboard on the t440s was very good, and well, the one on the x220 is so, so
    much better. It's not a chiclet keyboard, it's a full size keyboard, the key
    depth is very good and typing on it is a delight.
    </p>

    <p>
    All in all, I think I actually like the x220 better than the t440s. 
    </p>

    <p>
    Sure, it's a bit thicker than the t440s, but both weight about the same, and
    it's smaller, which means that it's easier to carry around.  Both have a good
    IPS matte display, with a better resolution for the t440s 14'' display, but the
    keyboard on the x220 is definitely superior.
