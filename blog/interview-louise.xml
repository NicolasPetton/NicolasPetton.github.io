    <p>
    It&rsquo;s been almost six months now since I moved to Stockholm, working
    full-time at <a href="http://foretagsplatsen.se/en">Företagsplatsen</a> as a software engineer, and this is the
    third post of my series of interviews of my colleagues.
    </p>

    <p>
    Louise joined the team in January. She was previously working at
    PwC, one of our customers. We started doing this interview on her
    first week in the team, and I&rsquo;ve been working with her for a month
    now, which has been a lot of fun!
    </p>

    <p>
    <b><i>Hi Louise, thanks for taking this interview. Can you start by
    telling me a bit about yourself?</i></b>
    </p>

    <p>
    Hi Nico, here we go!
    </p>

    <p>
    My name is Louise Axhake, I was born in the summer of 1981 on Öland,
    an island south east of Sweden and I have since then mowed up through
    the country and are now living in Uppsala just north of Stockholm.  I
    live there with my husband Anders and our three sons; Hector, Sixten
    and Fred.
    </p>

    <p>
    I&rsquo;m the newling at Företagsplatsen, writing this I&rsquo;m on my way to my
    third day. Before I worked with one of our clients with system and
    project management and also some marketing and communication.  I don&rsquo;t
    have any academic background to talk about, I&rsquo;m just very curious and
    want to know as much as possible about as much as possible. 😉
    </p>

    <p>
    <b><i>How was your first week in the team?</i></b>
    </p>

    <p>
    My first week was good! I have known Anders since 2009 if I remember
    correct. Företagsplatsen is a supplier for the company where I used
    to work, us knowing each other kind of helps not feeling like a
    complete stranger. I like that this is a way smaller company, that
    everybody counts, no one disappears in the crowd.
    </p>

    <p>
    You have all been very welcoming to me, I don´t have any less good
    stuff to tell, not yet at least ;)
    </p>

    <p>
    <b><i>What does a typical day at work look like?</i></b>
    </p>

    <p>
    It&rsquo;s too soon to say anything about at typical work day for me,
    there´s still things to figure out how it works around here, so I
    guess that´s what I do, figuring things out.
    </p>

    <p>
    But I can tell that my work days usually starts on the train, today
    I took my kids to school so I´m going to be at the office around
    9.30 am, that´s like one hour after the train left Uppsala.
    </p>

    <p>
    The days that I don´t have the kids in the morning I start off a bit
    earlier getting on a train 7.10 or 7.20 am, I pick up my computer
    almost right away and go through my mail and if I missed anything on
    Slack I catch up on that. So far I have read a lot about Microsoft´s
    Office 365, to say it simple, it´s a platform were a company can
    share information both internal and external.  I´m trying to find
    out how we can get the most out of it, get all our &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; on one
    place and really easy to find. This week I will also begin the work
    with the communication to our clients about the release of our new
    version. And I guess, some testing.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b><i>What are you main hobbies?</i></b>
    </p>

    <p>
    This is where I wish that I could say that one of my biggest hobbies
    is to work out, running or something healthy like that. But no.
    </p>

    <p>
    I used to read a lot, before I had kids, now I&rsquo;m either always
    interrupted when I try to or too tired. 
    </p>

    <p>
    Now I&rsquo;m more hooked on TV series, that doesn&rsquo;t take to much of an
    effort and is kinda nice and relaxing to do when the kids are
    asleep. I watch all kinds of genres. Game of Thrones, Breaking bad,
    Sons of Anarchy, House of Cards, Californication, Orange is the new
    black, True blood and the list goes on and on. You could say this is
    my second addiction.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b><i>You really made me ask: What is your first addiction then?</i></b>
    </p>

    <p>
    Sugar candy.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b><i>During his interview, Johan had a question for you: what is you biggest concern with your new job? To be the only girl or to work with french people;) ?</i></b>
    </p>

    <p>
    First, thank´s for calling me a girl, that´s nice comparing with &ldquo;tant&rdquo;
    (swedish word for old lady), that some random parent at my kids school
    called me this morning when talking to his kid.
    </p>

    <p>
    I would say working with french people, and that sounds really bad, I know.
    And I wouldn´t call it a concern, more a challenge for me, who never speaks
    anything but Swedish, now need to translate everything in my head before
    talking. And maybe it´s not even a concern anymore, kind of gotten used to
    it by now. You french guys are the best!
    </p>

    <p>
    <b><i>If you were doing an interview of one of your colleagues, what
    question would you ask him?</i></b>
    </p>

    <p>
    What do you think that your personality can provide to
    Företagsplatsen, as a co-worker, that no one else at this company
    can?
    </p>

    <p>
    <b><i>Thank you Louise for this interview!</i></b>
