    <p>
    This is the fifth post of my series of interviews, in which I
    <a href="http://nicolas-petton.fr/blog/working-at-rmod.html#MissingReference">interview my colleagues</a> of the <a href="http://rmod.lille.inria.fr/web/">RMoD</a> team. After the <a href="http://nicolas-petton.fr/blog/interview-jean-baptiste.html#MissingReference">Interview with
    Jean-Baptiste Arnaud</a>, I interview <a href="http://playingwithobjects.wordpress.com/">Guillermo Polito</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Guille (pronounce it Guiche) is another one of the <a href="http://playingwithobjects.wordpress.com/">many</a> <a href="http://marianopeck.wordpress.com/">argentinians</a>
    who have been working at <a href="http://inria.fr">Inria</a>. Guille is doing a PhD in RMoD, he
    drinks mate all day long (which argentinian doesn't?), and he's
    always in when it comes to going for a beer <a href="http://www.cafecitoyen.org/">somewhere</a> in Lille after
    work.
    </p>

    <b><i>Hi Guille, thanks for taking this interview. Can you tell me a
    bit about yourself?</i></b>
    </p>

    <p>
    Hi Nico, you're welcome.
    </p>

    <p>
    My name is Guille(rmo) Polito. Please call me Guille :). And pronounce
    every letter. Specially the 'll' as the english sound for 'sh' or the
    french 'ch'.
    </p>

    <p>
    Bref. I come from Buenos Aires, Argentina. 27. I am a systems engineer from
    there. I worked many years in C#, Java, Android, Python. I used to teach
    there a bit also. And started doing some open source with Pharo before
    graduating. Now, I'm doing a PhD at Lille/Douai where I have fun with
    Pharo, the CAR and RMoD teams. The PhD topic is fuzzy. I don't want to talk
    about my phd. Arghhh stop it!!!
    </p>

    <p>
    People tell me I'm not at all polite, despite what my surname
    is. Bah, maybe that's a bit true. Acid, yeller, hate
    formalities. Sometimes they call me Lorenzo after Lorenzo Lamas
    because of the long dark hair I think (they can say better
    probably). In fact, a picture of him inspired a picture of me.
    </p>

    <p><span class="figure-number">Figure 2:</span> Guillermo Lamas</p>
    </div>

    <p>
    Funny fact: when I started my blog I had that picture
    in the front page. Guess where I had the most clicks on? Certainly
    not my posts...
    </p>

    <p>
    Last but not least: Bostero. That is, fan of the best football team in the
    world, you know? If you don't know Boca Juniors, you know nothing about
    football.
    </p>


    <p>
    <b><i>What are you working on in the RMoD team?</i></b>
    </p>

    <p>
    Plenty of stuff! Concretely I'm doing a Phd, i'm in the last year. I would
    say that my Phd topic is about the manipulation of first class
    representations of object environments, those that we call object spaces,
    or Oz :)... And on top of that there are some things going on, in
    particular the Pharo bootstrap, and Tornado (my secret project that will
    come to light soon).
    </p>

    <p>
    Besides my Phd obligations, I also participate in Pharo, as almost everyone
    in RMoD. Sometimes doing VM stuff, sometimes on the image side... Sometimes
    when I have time I do things around DBXTalk and Glorp too. But basically
    I'd say I have fun :).
    </p>

    <p>
    <b><i>How would you describe RMoD besides work?</i></b>
    </p>

    <p>
    I'd describe it as fun. I actually really enjoy coming to the lab, except
    when Nico is there (joke!).
    </p>

    <p>
    No, really, you always find somebody open to discuss, to work in pairs, or
    even to just drink a mate. It's not difficult to find people that would
    like to share a beer after work. People receive you with jokes or insults,
    that makes me feel at home :). Really!
    </p>

    <p>
    <b><i>Esteban had a question for the next interview: "Would you like
    another beer?</i></b>
    </p>

    <p>
    Actually that's a great question in the context of our team! I think RMoD
    is located in one of the best places in the world beer-wise speaking :).
    </p>

    <p>
    So... Bien s√ªr! Une Kwak stp!
    </p>

    <p>
    <b><i>What question would you ask another member of the team?</i></b>
    </p>

    <p>
    God, there are so many good ones like...
    </p>

    <p>
    What question would you ask another member of the team?
    When is that beer?
    Emacs or Vim?
    </p>

    <p>
    But I'd better go for... Do you prepare mate?
    </p>



    <p>
    <b><i>Thank you Guille!</i></b>
